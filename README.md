# Tip-Calculator-Java
Just a simple Tip Calculator in java for class

This is one of our first projects in my Comp Sci class. I've been teaching myself javascript and react for about a year now. But in college we have to use java, so I am just trying to get familiar with how to use eclipse and how to push projects to github using eclipse. This, like I said is only a simple Calculator that prompts the user to enter the bill, and then enter the gratuity rate they want to tip the waiter. The calculator adds the total up and tells the user what the total bill is.
